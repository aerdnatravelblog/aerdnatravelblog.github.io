You can either buy a tour from guides on the street, in your hostel or you can get there on your own with a bus and a boat. We red on the internet that you can try to find a spot on a boat close to Mercado Bazurto and you dont have to pay 12.000 COP park fee. </p><p>We chose the easy way and booked a tour for 85.000 COP p.p. including transportation and accomodation for one night on Playa Blanca. The chartered bus took us to a small harbor where a boat was waiting for us. The ride with the boat takes around 1 hour. We stayed at "Hostal Playa Blanca" where we had a small hut-like room (cabana). All hostels are located directly on the beach 10m max from the sea. </p><p>The beach is amazing, the sand is almost white and the water warm and turkquise. The locals stay on one side of the beach which is very crowded. However the hostels are on the other side of the beach and are not so busy. </p><p>You will find various restaurants and stands with food on Playa Blanca. We recommend to go to the part where the locals are staying, where you can order a plate with fresh fish for 10.000 - 12.000 COP. In the evening the prices could be higher (20.000 COP). The salesman with the stalls offer shrimps or langustas (from august), but be prepared for high prices, but you can always bargain with them. We wanted a portion of shrimps. The merchant started with 30.000 COP. We were able to negotiate it down to 15.000 COP. Same goes for cocktails from the stands. If you want, cocktails are severd in pinapple or coconut. We bargained the price for two pinapple pina coladas to 23.000 COP, 7.000 COP less then the initial price. </p><p>You can rent a jetski for 30.000 COP per 15 minutes. We borrowed snorkels, but we did not see anything interesting on the sea bed.</p><p><img src="/img/cartagena/playa_blanca1.jpg" alt="Playa Blanca" title="Playa Blanca""/> <img src="/img/cartagena/playa_blanca2.jpg" alt="Playa Blanca" title="Playa Blanca""/></p><h3>City center</h3><p>Historic center is small, so you can walk around. It is surrounded by city walls. The architecture is simillar to southern cities in Spain. You can find beautiful patios and balconies covered with flowers. Just take a camera and get lost for few hours. This district is posh and mostly expensive. You can find very expensive restaurants, butique hotels and jewelery shops, specialized in emeralds. But also lot of nice design shops selling original swimsuits, shoes and hand made jewelery. </p><p>But of course you can do it on budget and eat on the street or find menu el dia and live in a hostel at district Getsemani. Unfortunately we didn't have enough time to explore Getsemani. It's covered with street art, we saw pieces from Bogotas artist DJLU on Calle de la Sierpe. In the evening visit Plaza de la Trinidad where locals hang out, kids play football. Have some fresh arepas or hamburgers from the stalls. Then visit some of the bars, they have happy hours for cocktails and special offers, like 2 for 20.000 COP. We heard that on Calle Arsenal are some cool clubs but we went on Tuesday so they were closed or totaly empty. </p><p><img src="/img/cartagena/cartagena_center1.jpg" alt="Cartagena Center" title="Cartagena Center""/> <img src="/img/cartagena/cartagena_center2.jpg" alt="Cartagena Center" title="Cartagena Center""/> </p><h3>Naval museum</h3><p>It's located in the historic center and the admission is 8.000 COP p.p.. The museum has two large wings. The lower one is dedicated to the naval history of Colombia and especialy Cartagena de Indias. You could spend hours reading the information boards, few of them are in english. The second wing is dedicated to modern Colombian navy. We had lot of fun in a model of submarine command bridge, pushing buttuns, playing with periscope and shooting enemy ships. </p><h2>Food</h2><p>You are on the coast so try some fresh fish or sea food. Now in July is the season for fish Mujarra. Menu del dia will set you back for some 10.000-15.000 COP. In the evening the street sellers offer classic arepa con queso (grilled corn paddy filled with cheese) for some 1.000 COP. Besides that they have meat sticks, potatoes filled with meat or fried cheese rolls. </p><p><img src="/img/cartagena/food1.jpg" alt="Food" title="Food""/> </p><h3>Restaurante Atahualpa</h3><p>We chose the menu with fish for 10.000 COP. Fish soup was very good with whole pieces of meat and yuka, sprinkled with cilantro leaves and lime juice. The main course consists of fish, rice, beans in sauce and pickled vegetables. The portions were big. We also recommend to try their lulu juice. </p><p><img src="/img/cartagena/food2.jpg" alt="Food" title="Food""/> </p></p>
