				<h1>Salento</h1>

			<p><p><img src="/img/medellin/medellin_header.jpg"/></p><p>We were walking through the Cocora Valley making our way down from the exhausting trek. The views are astonishing, especially on the second half of the tour, where you get to see the whole valley with its palm trees and the surrounding mountains. We stop at a small view point to get some rest and to shoot pictures. Suddenly we see something moving in the bushes close by. A few seconds later a small bear like creature appears very close to us. It was more surprised then us, starring at us with disbelief. Shocked as it was it tried to run away, but it was so clumsy that it rolled down the hill a few meters back into the bushes. It had troubles to get on its feet, complaining audibly. We observed it a few seconds longer before it disappeared out of our sight. Later we learned that it was a nausea, one of many animals that live in the area around Salento. </p><h2>How to get there</h2><p>Take a bus from Medellin terminal sur, located nearby El Poblado, for 41.000 COP. The road is going through serpentines and it can give your stomach a hard time. Half of the way is like a roller coaster ride, not the easiest bus ride with a hangover. The bus heads to Armenia, where you can take another bus to Salento. However the exit to Salento is on the way, so by going to Armenia you would have to go the same way back. Tell the driver to drop you off on the exit. On the other side of the road is a small bus stop. Just be there on time, before 6:00pm and you should be fine. This part of Colombia is safe and as it happened, we arrived after sunset and there was no bus. We had to hitchhike to Salento. It took us only 15 minutes to catch a pickup. Though we were lucky, there is very little traffic.</p><h2>About</h2><p>Salento is a cute little town in central Colombia. Famous for its landscape and its coffee production. You can easily spend a week there, exploring and hiking the surrounding mountains. It's very popular with backpackers, but there is not much to do after the sunset. A few small bars with pool tables and music, but thats pretty much it. </p><h2>Attractions</h2><h3>Cocora valley</h3><p>First you need to jump on one of the jeeps that leave from the main plaza every morning. The last ones are leaving at 9:30 and it costs 3.400 COP p.p.. The way takes about 30 minutes and the jeep will take you to the entrance of Cocora. You have a few hike possibilities from here, as you can find out on the information table with a map. We did the longer round trip hike, which takes 4-5 hours. First it will take you on a mud way around the fields. Then it gets more interesting as the path turns into the jungle, jumping over stones, crawling under branches and crossing several hanging bridges. After that we started to ascend to Finca Montana (2860m altitude). After a short rest, finally we started to descent to Cocora Valley. We shot 200 pictures of the valley, it is breath taking. Take your time, sit on the view points and make a picnic. This is our second favorite place in Colombia, after Tayrona [link].</p><h3>Horse riding</h3><p>Ask around on the main square for "caballo" and expect to pay at least 20.000 COP p.p. for one hour. Our guide ask us, if we are experienced and when Andrea told him "un poco", she got really wild big horse that wanted to run all the time. Thanks god, the guide switched the horse with her and she got a nice pony :) For Igor it was the first time riding a horse and he couldn't choose any better then a horse that walked like on autopilot - refusing to take any orders from him:) Nice experience, we definitely want to do it again.</p><h2>Food</h2><p>To our surprise, you can find several good places to eat in this small town.</p><h3>Parilla</h3><p>They have just grilled meat, nothing for vegeterians. We had pork ribs and a steak. The meat was very tender and the marinade for the ribs was amazing. Finally no rice but a potato as side dish and nice salad! With two Club Colombia beers we paid 38.000 COP, generous tip included. </p><h3>American brunch</h3><p>Perfect place for hangover food. The portions are unbelievable, you can't ever eat whole portion. We had a burrito and hash... Everything was pretty good and tasty but we absolutely loved the peanut butter brownie with vanilla ice cream. The coffee is not great but you pay one cup and you will get as many as you wish, like in States. Half of the burrito we took with us and ate like a dinner. So for 40.00 COP we were covered for whole day. </p><h2>Where to stay</h2><p>There are plenty of hostels in Salento, but if you are coming in night, book something in advance.</p><h3>Camelot</h3><p>Very nice, clean and quiet hostel located five minutes walk from the main square. Pretty comfortable bed, but the rooms are mostly without windows. You can also use the kitchen, dining room and terrace. For double room expect to pay 50.000 COP per night. </p></p>
