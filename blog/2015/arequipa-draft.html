			<p><p><img src="/img/arequipa/arequipa_header.jpg"/></p><p>When we arrived to Cabanaconde we didn't have almost any idea how we will manage our trip in the Colca canyon. We were still very tired after the hike to Machu Picchu, Santa Cruz trek, cycling in Paracas Natural Reserve and other activities what we've done in Peru. So we decided to don't book any tour and just spend two days in the canyon, walk our tempo. We slept over in the morning and started to hike too late. The sun was burning our skin like hell and we were slipping on the sandy earth. We were so happy when we arrived in the evening to the Oasis Sangalle. We spend the afternoon by the swimming pool, sipping cocktails and watching movies. After a hell, paradise! We almost forgot that we have to wake up at 3:00 am and start to climb up the hill, kilometers back to Cabanaconde. After few cocktails we started to talk with a Peruvian tourist guide. He told us that he wants to visit Czech Republic and we convinced him to go also to Slovakia. We gave him some tips about our countries, between them also how to ask for beer and he invited us for wine.<br/>The morning was difficult:) We imagined that the climb will be hard, but this was three hours of pure torture! Never again and especially not with a hangover. Andrea was probably still drunk when we were almost on the top and she remembered one more phrase to learn our new Peruvian friend, "Ukaz kozy", "Show me your tits" (surprisingly in our language this sounds better). Few days ago, he messaged us and he didn't forget the phrase. So Czech girls, be aware, he is gonna use it:)</p><p><img src="/img/arequipa/arequipa1.jpg" alt="Arequipa" title="Arequipa""/></p><h2>About</h2><p>The city is surrounded by volcanoes and the historic center is listed as UNESCO World heritage site. The white houses reminded us "pueblos blancos" in the south of Spain, in Andalucia. Although the center is beautiful, it is pretty small and it can be visited in a day. We enjoyed the food scene as well. The biggest attraction of this region is the Colca canyon, which shouldn't be missed. </p><p><img src="/img/arequipa/arequipa2.jpg" alt="Arequipa" title="Arequipa""/></p><h2>How to get to Arequipa</h2><p>After Machu Picchu we come come back to Cusco and took a night bus with TEPSA company to Arequipa. We got food and the bus was very comfortable. We can not recommend enough to go with this company for just 70 PEN p.p. We bought the tickets on-line here<br/>* <a href="http://www.go2peru.com/peru_bus.htm">go2peru</a></p><p><img src="/img/arequipa/arequipa3.jpg" alt="Arequipa" title="Arequipa""/></p><h2>Attractions</h2><p>Almost everybody visit the Monastery of Santa Catalina when in Arequipa. We didn't because 70 PEN is way too much for visit a church. </p><h3>Free walking tour</h3><p>The meeting is every day at 11:50 in San Francisco square and starts at 12:20. It takes about four hours. We got some general informations about the city, the way how they live, what they eat and something about the history. We went to the bridge to see volcanoes and then back to the city center to visit a brewery. This was our favorite part, the owner told us a lot about the local beer and gave us some beer to taste.<br/>We also visited an alpaca wool factory to found out about different types of the fiber and the animals. We didn't have any clue that they are capturing vicunas, which are wild animals, to get their fiber. Even if it would be true and just certificated indigenous people could do it, the animal has enormous stress when is being captured. Thankfully they didn't push us to buy anything.<br/>Then we visited chocolate factory and got some chocolate tea to try. There was our tour finished, stay there for beer. They have excellent selection.<br/>Our guide was Carlos, he was nice but the problem with him is that he really doesn't speak good English and it is very difficult to understand him. However we gave him tip on the end. </p><p><img src="/img/arequipa/arequipa4.jpg" alt="Arequipa" title="Arequipa""/></p><p><img src="/img/arequipa/arequipa5.jpg" alt="Arequipa" title="Arequipa""/></p><p><img src="/img/arequipa/arequipa6.jpg" alt="Arequipa" title="Arequipa""/></p><h3>Museum of Andean Sanctuaries</h3><p>The museum is devoted to "Mummy Juanita". A small girl who sacrificed her life in hope that she will save here people from the anger of the gods. First we watched a short video and then we were sent to the very cold room where we could see the well preserved mummy. The entrance is 20 PEN.</p><h2>Food</h2><h3>La Nueva Palomino</h3><p>We got this tip from our guide on free walking tour. Go just if you are really hungry, the portions are enormous. This "Picanteria", how the people are here calling restaurants serves typical food from Arequipa. You can try Rocoto relleno, a spicy paprika filled with meat and spice, served with a potato pie. We wanted to try everything so we chose a plate for two people with different cuts of pork, Rocoto, beef in a stew and corn. We couldn't move after this for whole day but everything was super delicious. Especially the rocoto and the beef was amazing. With chicha morada we paid 80 PEN. Address:Leoncio Prado 122 - Yanahuara</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/LaNuevaPalomino/">https://www.facebook.com/LaNuevaPalomino/</a></p><p><img src="/img/arequipa/arequipa7.jpg" alt="Palomino" title="Palomino""/></p><h3>Chelawasi</h3><p>You have to visit this amazing brewery. We loved their beer, they have wide selection of beers. We visited it with the free walking tour and then we came back, two times:) They have also lot of American style food, chicken wings, hamburgers or fries. And the staff is super friendly. The handcrafted beer is not cheap, but you pay for the quality. Address:102 Campo Redondo</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Chelawasi/">https://www.facebook.com/Chelawasi/</a></p><p><img src="/img/arequipa/arequipa8.jpg" alt="Chelawasi" title="Chelawasi""/></p><h3>Hatunpa</h3><p>In this restaurant you will eat potatoes. They are specialized on the food from this vegetable. You can try traditional Peruvian Rocoto or Alpaca. For two dishes, Chicha and beer we paid 50 PEN.<br/>Adress:Ugarte 208. </p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Hatunpa-Sac-240019449355036/">https://www.facebook.com/Hatunpa-Sac-240019449355036/</a></p><p><img src="/img/arequipa/arequipa9.jpg" alt="Hatunpa" title="Hatunpa""/></p><h3>Chaqchao chocolate factory</h3><p>We found out that in Arequipa is very popular to connect chocolate and handcrafted beer. We think that it is the best combination. But their chocolate is very delicious and the beer as well. They have also cosmetics made out of chocolate, the lip balm from cacao butter is great. Be prepared for higher prices. </p><p><img src="/img/arequipa/arequipa10.jpg" alt="Chaqchao" title="Chaqchao""/></p><p><img src="/img/arequipa/arequipa11.jpg" alt="Chaqchao" title="Chaqchao""/></p><h2>Colca canyon</h2><p>There are tons of tourist agencies offering this tour. We decided to do it on our own. We took a bus from the Arequipa terminal to Cabanaconde. The bus is leaving at 9:15 am and takes about seven hours. You can take an earlier one at 3 am or 5 am in the morning. It costs 17 PEN.<br/>We came late in the afternoon so we decided to sleep in Cabanaconde and start the hike at seven in the morning. Just go the same way out of the city how you came with the bus and then turn left on the mirador. There are no direction markers, but it is really difficult to get lost as you can just descend deeper to the canyon. The descending is very difficult for knees and it takes about two hours. Then we arrived to the first bridge, crossed the river and arrived to the village San Juan de Chuccho. We enjoyed some beers and had a rest. It is also possible to stay over night in the "Hospedaje" or have a lunch. After that we ascent to Cosnirhua, it took one hour. From there we could enjoy the views over the canyon. From there it was just few minutes to Malata, where you can also stop by for food. But we continued straight to the oasis as we couldn't wait to have a bath in their pool. The descend took two hours and it was very difficult after such a long day. We arrived exhausted. We were so happy that we got a bungalow and proper food. After the food we spent rest of the day by the pool. The price for the bungalow was 30 PEN and for a meal 10 PEN. We slept just few hours and then at 3:30 am we started to ascend to Cabanaconde. It was very difficult hike taking 2.5 hours. Take a headlamp and start as soon as possible. The heat in the canyon is unbearable during the day. We caught the bus at 7:00 am and even had enough time to have a breakfast before. </p><p>The costs of our short Colca canyon trip p.p.:</p><p>AQP to Cabanaconde and back 34 PEN<br/>Cabanaconde one night 20 PEN<br/>The entrance to the canyon 70 PEN<br/>Lunch in Sangalle 10 PEN<br/>One night in Sangalle 15 PEN</p><p>together 149 PEN (44 USD)</p><p><img src="/img/arequipa/arequipa12.jpg" alt="Colca canyon" title="Colca canyon""/></p><p><img src="/img/arequipa/arequipa13.jpg" alt="Colca canyon" title="Colca canyon""/></p><p><img src="/img/arequipa/arequipa14.jpg" alt="Colca canyon" title="Colca canyon""/></p></p>
