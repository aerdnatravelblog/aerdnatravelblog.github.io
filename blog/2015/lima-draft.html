				<h1>Lima					</h1>
			</div>
		
		
			<p><p><img src="/img/lima/lima_header.jpg"/></p><p>We stayed in Lima with really great guy who showed us around the city, we drunk together, we partied together. He helped to experience this great city like a local. We met him thanks to Couchsurfing, we couldn't spend the time better then staying with him. One evening he couldn't join us for drinks because he didn't feel well so he cold his friend to go out with us. We really understood each other and the time was flying. We visited many clubs and drunk a lot. In the morning when last club was closing he offered us that we can sleep in his house. It was too late to ring the door of our couchsurfer host. We really don't remember how we got there but in few hours we woke up with a terrible hangover and wanted to go "home". After a quick talk with our new friend we decided to go together out. In front of the door Niky told us that he forgot something and we can wait for him. So we sat down and he left to the kitchen. After ten minutes we started to worry a bit so Andrea went to look for him. He wasn't there anymore, we found in the kitchen just a small dog barking hysterically on us. We decided to leave so we opened the door and went to the gate, but the gate was closed. We sat down again and decided to wait for him. After one hour we started to panic a bit. We wanted to go through the garden but there was another dog, a big one. We were thinking to climb the fences but that was impossible because the house was built like a fortress. There were spikes on the walls so nobody could climb over. After one hour and half we were desperate. We were so thirsty and hungry locked in a house. There was lot of conspiratorial theories going in our still drunk minds. After a while we saw a car coming, it was our friend! He told us that he had to pick up something and he acted like nothing happened. Of course nothing happened, but in this situation with crazy hangover we were thinking that we will die there!:) We came to our CS host house and started to cook Goulash, Czechoslovakian specialty for the family. Our kidnapper asked if we can save a bit for him. Igor blinked at me and said in Czech "Yeah but firstly we will lock you here for few hours."</p><p><img src="/img/lima/lima1.jpg"/></p><h2>About</h2><p>Lima is the capital city of Peru. Many people just come to the airport and in few hours leave. There is a gossip about this city going around how is this city ugly and is not worth it. We will try to convince you that it is a lie. Lima has undoubtedly on of the best food scenes in SA. You could spend weeks here exploring restaurants and cafes. It has also very European vibe. We were surprised finding German style houses all over the city. It is very modern city, but the center is in colonial style.<br/>We liked most the districts Miraflores and Barranco where you can find great restaurants, bars and music clubs, they are close to the beach. The con of Lima is definitely the weather, because of the see there is almost always cloudy and humid. But also Lima has great surfing conditions so take a wet suit and enjoy the waves. There are many surfing school on the beach offering courses or rent the boards.<br/>We recommend to spend at least four days to cover the most famous districts and enjoy the best food.</p><p><img src="/img/lima/lima2.jpg"/></p><h2>How to get to Lima</h2><p>There are many companies going to Lima from Huaraz. We recommend to check regularly Cruz del Sur web page as they have very often sales on the tickets. We took Zbuss and we were very happy. We got seats in the first floor which is always better in Peru because it is more spacious. The seats were adjustable, there was a toilet and we got even some food. It was an overnight bus, the journey took about 8 hours. It costs 40 PEN and we would say that the quality was almost the same like with Cruz del Sur.</p><p><img src="/img/lima/lima3.jpg"/></p><h2>Attractions</h2><h3>Museum Larco</h3><p>One of the most organized and beautiful museums in SA, maybe because it is privately owned. It is pretty expensive, 30 PEN but it is worth it. It is not large, reserve two hours for this visit. First check the informative video and then start to explore. It is very popular also because of the erotic exposition. Some of the figures were pretty weird, like a woman having a sex with a dead man and beating with a stick another man. </p><p><img src="/img/lima/lima4.jpg"/></p><p><img src="/img/lima/lima5.jpg"/></p><p><img src="/img/lima/lima6.jpg"/></p><h3>The Mistura food festival</h3><p>This annual festival is the biggest food festival in South America. We were so lucky to be in Lima in this time (13.9. 2015). We like the most the part with sea food and ceviches.<br/><img src="/img/lima/lima7.jpg"/><br/>Then we tried Peruvian specialty, Anticuchos (grilled beef hearts). The meat was tender and well seasoned, the stall was from restaurante Grimanesa, adress:Felipe Barreda 475, Miraflores.<br/><img src="/img/lima/lima9.jpg"/><br/>Big surprise was the dish called "Asado de tira estofado en cerveza negra", meat cooked with black beer from restaurant Catalina 555, adress:Av. Santa Catalina 555, Lima. The meat was beautifully tender and aromatic because of the beer.<br/><a href="https://www.facebook.com/perucatalina">Catalina 555</a></p><p><img src="/img/lima/lima8.jpg"/></p><p>Then we tried "Causa" another very traditional pervuian food. It is potato mash flavored with lime and filled with layers of fish, in this case with prawns. This restaurant is in Chaclayo, not in Lima.<br/><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Kausaq.Chaclacayo">Kausaq</a><br/>Then we tried cocktails from bar Ayahuasca, chiclayo and maracuya pisco. Very good taste and strong enough. You can find this bar on Av. San Martin 130, Barranco.</p><p><img src="/img/lima/lima10.jpg"/></p><p>We also enjoyed the Grand Market where farmers were offering different local products like fruit, vegetables, chocolate, coffee, nuts and much more. We learn a lot about peruvian food and ingredients. It was very well spend afternoon.<br/><img src="/img/lima/lima11.jpg"/></p><p><img src="/img/lima/lima12.jpg"/></p><p><img src="/img/lima/lima13.jpg"/></p><h2>Food</h2><h3>Barranco Beer company</h3><p>This brewery located in Barranco offers handcrafted beers. You can choose from lager, weed beer, pale ale, amber beer, american IPA or brown beer. We like the most their Pale-X. To choose your beer, order the selection. Small beers cost about 8 PEN, big ones (600 ml) costs 15 PEN. They have also food, we didn't try but the pizza looked pretty good.</p><p><img src="/img/lima/lima14.jpg"/></p><p><a href="http://www.barrancobeer.com/">Beer company</a> Av Almirante Miguel Grau 308, Barranco</p><h3>Salchipapa</h3><p>When in Lima, you have to try salchipapa, fries covered with sausage chunks and different sauces. It is perfect hangover food. </p><h3>La Lucha</h3><p>This fast food chain serves sandwiches. You can choose from baked pork (chancho a la lena), hamburger, pavo (grilled turkey) or sandwich with beef. They have the best chicha morada ever! We haven't find better even in good restaurants. And the sandwiches are out of this world. So are the fries, they use different kinds of potatoes so you can find in your fries also red potato. The prices are ok, for sandwich the price starts on 13 PEN, fries (share in two, the portion is too big) 5 PEN, big chicha 4.50 PEN. You can find La Lucha also in Arequipa.<br/><a href="http://www.lalucha.com.pe/">La Lucha</a> Av. Santa Cruz 747, Miraflores</p><p><img src="/img/lima/lima15.jpg"/></p><h2>Nightlife</h2><p>Lima has pretty good nightlife. Head to Miraflores or to Barranco in the night and you won't be disappointed. There are plenty of bars. We spent one crazy night in clubs in Av. Bolognesi in Barranco, unfortunately we don't remember the names of the bars. We weren't so lucky to experience good music in any of them. After what we heard about clubs in shopping center in Miraflores, Larco we didn't want to go there. They are very racists and then don't let go indigenous people in. We won't support anything like this. </p></p>
