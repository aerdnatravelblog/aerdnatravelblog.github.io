			<p><p><img src="/img/ollantaytambo/ollantaytambo_header.jpg"/></p><p>Southern Peru is a big touristy attraction and you feel that almost everybody is trying to rip you of. Especially in tourist agencies, they are charging to much for trips. Almost every time is better to do it on your own. Sometimes it can be also difficult because of the lack of informations on internet. If you speak Spanish, ask locals about alternatives, use micro buses (small bus which leaves when it is full).<br/>We had a lot of experience with local transport when we came to Cusco. But the bus ride what we experienced on the way to Vicho was really crazy. When we caught the bus it was already full, however everybody was sitting. We were thinking that then we will go direct and stop just when somebody want to get off. We were stopping every few minutes for people to get in. Nobody wasn't getting off and the micro bus was for maximum 12 people. In a while it seemed impossible that more people will stuck in. Finally after half an hour of the ride some people started to leave the bus. Not fast enough, because just one person get off and three get in. Every time when somebody wanted to get off ten people had to step out to make a space for him.<br/>When the bus was taking a turn, people were moaning and pushing each other but nobody couldn't fell down because we were very tight pressed. Andrea had stuck a child leg in a belly. Igor was holding somebody's back and another small kid was sleeping on his shoulder and drooling on him. This was real Peruvian local experience!:) </p><p><img src="/img/ollantaytambo/ollantaytambo1.jpg" alt="Moray" title="Moray""/></p><h2>About</h2><p>Ollantaytambo is an ancient city located 60 km from Cusco. It is a good starting point for treks to Machu Picchu, Moray or Maras. During the Inca Empire, Ollantaytambo was the royal estate of Emperor Pachacuti who conquered the region. Here also Manco Inca won a major battle with the Conquistadores. The mody popular attraction in the city are the ruins, which are also included in the "Boleto Turistico".<br/>They say that the Sacred Valley is one of the beautiful places in the world, the sacred place of the Incas. We can agree. The views that we had on the way from Moray to Salinas and on the way to Machu Picchu were spectacular. </p><p><img src="/img/ollantaytambo/ollantaytambo2.jpg" alt="Moray" title="Moray""/></p><h2>How to get to Ollantaytambo</h2><p>We wanted to save time, so we visited Chinchero on the way to Ollantaytambo, also included in the "Boleto turistico". To get to Chinchero, take a bus from Av. Grau 525 in Cusco. It costs 6 PEN p.p. After a few hours of sight seeing, we stopped a collectivo for 3 PEN p.p. on the main road and we got to Urubamba. At Urubamba we stopped another collectivo for 3.5 PEN and we finally got to Ollantaytambo. </p><p><img src="/img/ollantaytambo/ollantaytambo3.jpg" alt="Maras" title="Maras""/></p><h2>Attractions</h2><h3>Chinchero</h3><p>How to get there we described above. You will find here extensive Inca ruins, beautiful colonial church and handcrafted market. The Inca ruins consists mostly from terraces, but you can also admire carvings made by Incas in caves and rocks. Surely they had religious purposes.<br/>The white colonial church is built on Inca foundations. The altar and decorations are made out of wood. We liked the architecture, although it looks that the statics of the church are very bad and it is somehow crooked.<br/>We bought also some souvenirs on the market. The prices were good, so we bargained a sweater for Igor, decorated ceramic mug and winter hat for Andrea for 70 PEN (21 USD). Because of the characteristic animal smell, we are pretty sure that at least Andrea's hat is made of alpaca. </p><p><img src="/img/ollantaytambo/ollantaytambo4.jpg" alt="Chinchero" title="Chinchero""/></p><p><img src="/img/ollantaytambo/ollantaytambo5.jpg" alt="Chinchero" title="Chinchero""/></p><p><img src="/img/ollantaytambo/ollantaytambo6.jpg" alt="Chinchero" title="Chinchero""/></p><h3>Moray</h3><p>We had a bit trouble to find cheap transport to get here. When we asked in Ollantaytambo, they told us price 70 PEN to get directly there. Then somebody advised us to go first to Urubamba and then take a collectivo. We went to the market from where are all the busetas leaving to different directions. We took a buseta to Urubamba for 1.50 PEN p.p. to the Urubamba terminal. From there they tried to rip us again, they wanted 40 PEN for a ride to Moray. We decided to go with regular buseta to Maras for 3 PEN p.p.. Maras is a village close to both of the sights, salt lands Salinas Maras and Moray. Then we could walk 8 kilometers to Moray but we tried to hitchhike and we made a deal with local for 10 PEN. He also showed us which way to take back to Maras.<br/>The purpose of these depressions is uncertain but we like the idea that Moray used to be an Inca laboratory. They were trying to grow crops from different regions of the empire. The terraces are in the circular shape and they are about 30 m deep. There can be even 15 degrees difference in temperature between the top and the bottom. </p><p><img src="/img/ollantaytambo/ollantaytambo7.jpg" alt="Moray" title="Moray""/></p><p><img src="/img/ollantaytambo/ollantaytambo8.jpg" alt="Moray" title="Moray""/></p><p><img src="/img/ollantaytambo/ollantaytambo9.jpg" alt="Moray" title="Moray""/></p><h3>Salinas de Maras</h3><p>We decided to walk the distance from Moray and we can really recommend you to do so as the views over the mountains and the valley are amazing. When you walk from the entrance of Moray go a while along the road where to buses are going but after a first canyon take a left and head through the fields. It is a dirt road and it will leads you straight to Maras. On the left is a small hill, on the right are remains of a wall. There is one intersection, take the road to the left, you will se agaves on the side and after 800 meters there will be a small farm house and you will cross a water channel and a reservoir. Continue to Maras. Once in Maras, get to the main plaza and continue to the main road out of Maras. After the village take a left to the dirt road and you will a sign on a post and you will continue to Salinas. From that point is 4 km more. The hike is definitely worth it but try to start in the morning.<br/>Since pre-Inca times they were obtaining salt by evaporating salt water from a subterranean stream. There are few hundreds of salt ponds where Peruvian families are working till nowadays.<br/>We have to say that the salt is delicious and the whole system looks spectacular especially when sun is shining, all the salt shine too. Then is possible to walk to the river and the main road to Urubamba or Ollantaytambo. Just take the dirt road above the Salinas and walk about 30 minutes down the road. You will come to the river, then turn right and search for a bridge. When you get over the bridge try to go straight and you will come on the main road. From there stop a micro bus.<br/>This sight is not included in "Boleto Turistico", it costs 10 PEN p.p.</p><p><img src="/img/ollantaytambo/ollantaytambo10.jpg" alt="Salinas" title="Salinas""/></p><p><img src="/img/ollantaytambo/ollantaytambo11.jpg" alt="Salinas" title="Salinas""/></p><p><img src="/img/ollantaytambo/ollantaytambo12.jpg" alt="Salinas" title="Salinas""/></p><h3>Ollantaytambo ruins</h3><p>They are located just on the edge of the city. When Inca Pachacutec conquered Ollantaytambo, he rebuilt the city and it served like an administration center of the empire. It also helped to Manco Inca to defeat the spanish conquistadores. From high above in the terraces of Ollantaytambo the Incas managed to hold back and defeat the Spanish, in addition they flooded the plain below forcing the Spanish to withdraw. Keep few hour for visiting this site. They have also alpacas and llamas over there. </p><p><img src="/img/ollantaytambo/ollantaytambo13.jpg" alt="Ollantaytambo" title="Ollantaytambo""/></p><p><img src="/img/ollantaytambo/ollantaytambo14.jpg" alt="Ollantaytambo" title="Ollantaytambo""/></p><p><img src="/img/ollantaytambo/ollantaytambo15.jpg" alt="Ollantaytambo" title="Ollantaytambo""/></p><h2>Food</h2><h3>Food festival in Urubamba</h3><p>We were again so lucky that we were in the city just in time to enjoy another food festival. Unlike the Mistura festival in Lima, this one was for free. The festival is organized annually, this year in the weekend 25.-27. of September. </p><p><img src="/img/ollantaytambo/ollantaytambo16.jpg" alt="Ollantaytambo" title="Ollantaytambo""/></p><p>First we tried a ceviche and cocktail from Tambo del Inca. Ceviche was really delicious well prepared and unusual because it was made from tuna fish. You can find this resort on Avenida Ferrocarril in Urubamba. The restaurant is a part of luxurious spa resort so be prepared for higher prices. We paid 15 PEN for a portion of ceviche. </p><p><img src="/img/ollantaytambo/ollantaytambo17.jpg" alt="Ollantaytambo" title="Ollantaytambo""/></p><p>Then we tried this amazing twelve hours cooked pork in local herbs, served with four different kinds of home made bread. The meat was melting in our mouthes and we couldn't be happier. Definitely try, they have also restaurant in Cusco. In Urubamba you can find this restaurant on Carretera Calca - Urubamba Km 57.2. Again we paid 15 PEN per portion.</p><p><img src="/img/ollantaytambo/ollantaytambo18.jpg" alt="Ollantaytambo" title="Ollantaytambo""/></p><p><a href="http://www.ifk.pe/en/restaurant.php/">Nunay</a></p><h3>Blue Magic</h3><p>Ollantaytambo is very touristy place, the restaurants are overpriced and not good. On the main square almost every place serves pizza (how peruvian). This was our favorite restaurant in Urubamba. Try their menu del dia or the alpaca steak for dinner. It was fresh and well prepared, traditional Peruvian food. For a lunch we paid 35 PEN for both of us. The staff is very friendly and the interior is cozy. You can find this restaurant in the city center on adress Av. Patacalle 115. </p><p><img src="/img/ollantaytambo/ollantaytambo19.jpg" alt="Ollantaytambo" title="Ollantaytambo""/></p><p><img src="/img/ollantaytambo/ollantaytambo20.jpg" alt="Ollantaytambo" title="Ollantaytambo""/></p><h2>Nightlife</h2><h3>Quechua blues bar cafe</h3><p>There is almost nothing to do after the dark. We explored this bar with a terrace and were happy to come back. They play reggae or indie music and the price are more then ok. This bar is located very close to the ruins on the calle Q'era. Try their "macerados", they have different kinds, we like the coca macerado and "canoso" made out of cane. One shot costs just around 7 PEN, but don't over do it like we did because the hangover is very strong and it is pretty difficult to get any sleep after the coca liqueur. </p></p>
