				<h1>Montanita &amp; Isla de la Plata</h1>

			<p><p><img src="/img/montanita/montanita_header.jpg"/></p><p>After the never ending 10 hours ride on a bus, we got off in the hippie village of Montanita. We booked our hostel in advance on hostelworld, because we knew that we will be tired after this long journey. Little did we know, what a fail it will be. At the bus stop was a line of hostel employees to offer us accommodation for less money and/or in better location. We rejected all the offers. One sympathetic guy with French accent approached us and asked about our hostel. When we said that it is located in the center, he just laughed and said that we won't get any sleep in the night. And we were like, "Ehm sure, what ever. We are used to it from parties.". We found our hostel and the manager. The twenty something surfer with blond dreadlocks opened the door to our room and a terrible chemical smell punched into our noses. We were thinking, maybe someone used a lot of mosquito repellent in there. We lied down into our bunk beds, in a room without a window. After two hours Andrea got the worst headache ever and both of us would still smell the chemical odor. We realized that the smell was coming from the freshly painted walls. We couldn't find the manager to confront him, so we packed and went out to search for Nicos hostel, our French connection. Luckily he had a private room for us. Sitting in the lounge area in Nicos hostel ChiChi Babylon, we glanced at the white board with the house rules: "Rule No. 6: In here we fuck Hostelworld with a big smile", which made us laugh. Now writing this article, we have a second laugh, as we have just discovered that Nico's hostel is listed on Hostelworld.</p><h1>Montanita</h1><h2>About</h2><p>Montanita is a small hippie town on the Ecuadorian coast with perfect conditions for surfing. It has great nightlife and nice beach. The only downside is that the weather is very often cloudy and there is a lot of mosquitoes. </p><h2>How to get to Montanita</h2><p>We went from Banos through Guayaquil. In Banos buy the ticket one day in advance if you want to travel early in the morning, it costs around 10 USD. Ask them also from where is the bus going because some of the companies are not allowed to go directly from terminal. They didn't tell us so our bus left, five minutes before six and in the office was no one. They arranged for us different bus but it wasn't direct and it was a lot of trouble...From Guayaquil bus terminal buy a ticket to Montanita, there is just one office selling them. It's about 6 USD. This journey took us whole day, we arrived at 5 pm. </p><h2>Surfing lessons</h2><p>The waves here are very strong, long and consistent. They hosts many international competitions. You can choose from many surfing schools or take a private teacher. That's usually a cheaper option. Igor took one lesson lasting for 1.5 hour for 20 USD. He was very happy with the teacher, if you will accommodate in ChiChi Babylon, ask Nico the owner about this lesson. Only one cone was the jelly fish, but that's pretty common in Pacific. </p><h2>Food</h2><h3>Cabana I Ciuchi</h3><p>This restaurant moved from beach to the center of town on Calle 15 Mayo. They serves sea food and international meals. We absolutely loved their langostinos, big schrimps. It's no cheap restaurant but also not the most expensive, prices begins somewhere on 12 USD. If you want something cheaper try "Brisa Sabores Peruanos". They are on the same street. </p><p><img src="/img/montanita/montanita1.jpg" alt="CabanaICiuchi" title="CabanaICiuchi""/></p><p><img src="/img/montanita/montanita2.jpg" alt="CabanaICiuchi" title="CabanaICiuchi""/></p><h3>Pigro</h3><p>Italian restaurant serving pasta and sea food. They have happy hours for cocktails. Try their pasta with "mariscos" sea food, it's absolutely amazing. This restaurant also doesn't belong to cheap ones, one dish is about 15 USD. It is located on calle Publica y 10. Agosto. </p><h2>Where to stay</h2><h3>ChiChi Babylone</h3><p>This hostel is located by the river, just five minutes walk from beach. The atmosphere is very social. There is a TV with Netflix, couches and hammocks. We found very nice people from UK, Australia and Belgium. We talked, laughed, drunk cheap and good ron every night. And then we went for party to the city. We appreciated that we could socialize but in the night was usually quiet. You can also use a kitchen and buy beers. First two nights we slept in the only double room what they have. The bed have a mosquito net and bathroom is just next door. Then we slept three nights in a dormitory for four people, no mosquito net but also with a bathroom next door. With hot water and very fast wifi for 8 USD per person it is a good deal.</p><h2>Nightlife</h2><p>There is a lot of to do during the whole week but on weekends is much better. You will find cocktail alley, street full of stands serving hundreds of different cocktails. Seriously we haven't ever seen such a wide selections. You can find everything from salsa discos, rock to electronic music. Some places are really weird, like Alcatraz. 3 floors disco looking like a prison. We stayed for five minutes and then we left. The place and music are awful. </p><h3>Lost Beach club</h3><p>The best place where to party is Lost Beach club. It's opened just on the weekends, so check their website for events. They have Function One sound system and pretty large space outside where you can dance under the night sky and then also dance floor inside. They have also regularly international artists, like Joyce Muniz, Bushwacka or Marcel Fengler from label Ostgut Ton. We visited the club Friday and Saturday as well. On Fridays they have ladies nights so ladies don't pay entrance. But on Saturdays they have more interesting events. We enjoyed set from Francesca Lombardi and Agents of Time. There was after party as well. We came on Sunday in the afternoon, crazy weekend. But it is for sure one of the best clubs in South America and it is almost on the beach!</p><p><a href="http://www.lostbeachclub.com/">http://www.lostbeachclub.com/</a></p><h1>Isla de la Plata</h1><p>This small island belong to natural park Machalilla. They are also called "Poor man Galapagos", because of the wildlife what you can find there. If you want to visit the island you have to go with a tour. The tours starts from Puerto Lopez, small fisherman town located two hours bus drive from Montanita (2.50 USD). It is hard to find hostel for 10 USD per night and the food there is not good or cheap neither. We heard that you can find tours for 30 USD and believe us we tried to bargain. But the cheapest price what we reached was 40 USD.<br/>On the end we went with Aventuras la Plata for 45 USD and we think that higher price was maybe influenced by the season of whales. They picked us up in our hostel, the boat was good and quite new and a lunch was included. We started very early in the morning, the bout ride takes about one hour. Firstly we went to see blue footed boobies. They are one of the funniest animals ever, we could spend hours watching them. We learned about the differences between male and female and how they are taking care about the small ones. They are looking for another partner every season, what a bitchy life!:)<br/>Then we watched frigatebirds, they can span their wings more then 2 meters. When they want to attract the females they inflate their red gular pouch. Sometimes it looks like that the bird will gonna explode every moment.<br/>Second part was on the boat, we saw sea turtles because they were feeding them. They are probably used to it, because they weren't afraid at all and they came very close to the boat. Then we had half an hour for snorkeling, but that was very difficult because of jelly fish. Anyway, we saw beautiful colored fishes.<br/>The third part of tour on the way back we watched whales. One of the most beautiful moments in our lives. We appreciated that the captain was respectful and every time he stopped the motor and tell us to be quiet and don't bother the animals. That day was very cloudy so the pictures are not he most beautiful ones but we were so happy to see them. It increased our love and respect to the nature even more. </p></p>
