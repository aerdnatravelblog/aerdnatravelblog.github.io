				<h1>Cuenca</h1>

			<p><p><img src="/img/cuenca/cuenca_header.jpg"/></p><p>We came to Cuenca to visit beautiful natural park El Cajas. Like always we didn't want to go with a tourist guide. We came to the visiter center to get a map. Unfortunately they didn't have any for us but we could make a picture of their map. We decided to do the moderate level of the track. There was also a bunch of German tourists who joined us. The guides from the center wanted to make sure that we won't get lost as the park is really big. They told us to stick together with the others and they called a car to bring us to the beginning of the track. We told to the driver which track we chose and he started to drive. We were very surprised when he took opposite direction but we were thinking, maybe he knows better way. He took us downhill on the beginning of the park and stopped the car. We explained him that we are at wrong place because we would have to climb for whole day to get to the right place. So he called the visitors center and he brought us to another point and almost left, when we found out that this trail is the easiest level. So we stopped him again and jumped in the car for the last time and finally he brought us to the right place. The best was when Igor told us that he noticed that this guy was reading tests to make a driving licence. Welcome in Ecuador, the country where anybody can do anything!:)</p><p><img src="/img/cuenca/cuenca1.jpg" alt="Cuenca" title="Cuenca""/></p><h2>About</h2><p>The beautiful historic city of Cuenca is located 2.500 m above the sea level. The city center is listed in UNESCO. It has charming atmosphere of the old times and good food scene. </p><h2>How to get to Cuenca</h2><p>We went from Puerto Lopez to Guayaquil for 5.25 USD. Then from Guayaquil to Cuenca it costs 8.25 USD. It is a long day in a bus.</p><h2>Attractions</h2><p>El Cajas</p><p>This national park is located 30 km from Cuenca in between 3.000 meters up to 4.500 meters. You can find more then 200 lagoons in pure unspoiled nature. The weather can change very fast so bring enough warm clothes. You don't need any tourist guide to explore the park. There are buses in the morning going from Cuenca. Wake up early in the morning, </p><p>The museum</p><p>This museum is great because of the outdoor part. There are archeaological excavation completed with real inca garden. You can find corn, quinoa, yucca, papas, kiwicha or even chili peppers and find out more about inca diet. They also planted herbs and domesticated animals like parrots or lizzards. What we didn't like at all was exposition with parrots and even eagels and a condor in very small cages. Big shame on you, museum...<br/>In the main building you can visit different expositions. We enjoyed the one dedicated to modern art in the ground floor. In upper floor is ethnological exposition which is very disorganized and poorly presented. The entrance is for free.</p><h2>Food</h2><p>Pizzeria</p><p>After a long day in bus and eating rice for two months we felt that we need to go to gringo restaurant and treat ourselfes. This restaurant attracted us with wide selection of cheese. Real cheese, no fresh cheese without taste what we had tasted. We ordered a plate with sausages, cheese and bread. Then pasta and red wine. Everything was delicious and fresh. The service was very confused, but that was because they were young. We paid 50 USD with tips included. </p><p>Waffles</p><p>This fast food you can find near by museum in the park. The Belguim chef will make fresh waffle in front of you and you can choose also fruit, ice cream and topping. The price is about 2 USD for a waffle. </p><p>Caffeteria Nice Cream</p><p>You can find this caffeteria also in Latacunga. The place is very popular with locals and you can choose from wide selection of ice cream, cakes and sandwiches. We liked their brownie with ice cream but sandwich was dissapointing. Good and cheap place for afternoon coffee and cake. </p><p>Pizzeria</p><p>Okay this wasn't the best pizza of our life, but it wasn't also the worst. The taste of the doll was good, they bake it in a wooden oven. The type of the cheese what they usually use here in SA doesn't taste good melted on pizza. This place is also pretty expensive, so we decided for take away, bought a beer and had the most wonderful evening in bed, watching a movie. The best thing after hiking El Cajas:)</p><h2>Where to stay</h2><p>Hostel Alvanos </p><p>We stayed here for three nights and we were very happy. The room was spacious and light. The hostel was clean and located in the city center, very close to restaurants and bars. It is a bit annoying that you have to ring every time when you want to enter the hotel. We paid 20 USD per night for a double room.</p></p>
