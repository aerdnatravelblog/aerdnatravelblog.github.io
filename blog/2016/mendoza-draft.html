			<p><p><img src="/img/mendoza/mendoza_header.jpg"/></p><p>When we arrived to Salta, we experienced one of the most humiliating situations in our trip. As we didn't exchange any dollars for ARS (pesos) in San Pedro de Atacama, we came to Salta without any money. It was Sunday night and this was our first Argentinian destination. We were very sure that we will find many Argentinians who will be happy to exchange with us their money in the unofficial rate. Imagine, in ATM you get 9 ARS for 1 USD and at the Blue market the rating is 14-15 ARS for 1 USD. You can save great money like this and for this reason also save your credit cards for another countries.<br/>Unfortunately there was no one on the streets on the Sunday evening so we decided to take money from an ATM. Our hostel wasn't directly in the city and we even didn't have money for bus tickets to get there. We tried dozens of ATMs and no one had money. We met several locals trying to take money as well. We looked at each other and we were thinking if this is real. Is this even possible in so developed country? Are they in the same shitty situation like Greece? Will they be closed for weeks? When the midnight and the leaving time of last bus to our hostel was coming we finally found some ATM with money but it didn't accept our Maestro card and then even our Visa card! We were almost giving up and thinking about sleeping in a park, when somebody change our money on the street and we could catch our last bus to Loki hostel. Don't stay there if you are planning spend just one night in Salta, it is really far away.<br/>When we arrived to Mendoza, we went to search for these moneychangers again. We got very good rating in Salta, 15 ARS for 1 USD and we expected the rating be even better in big city like Mendoza. The opposite was true, they were offering us 14 ARS/1 USD. After a while we found a guy who offered us 14.50 ARS/1 USD. We agreed and followed him to a passage where we entered a small office. The fat guy behind the thick glass window shook his head and said that the rating was changed few minutes ago and he can give us just 14 ARS/1 USD. Well played! We exchanged just 100 USD and decided to wait with exchanging more money for the capital city, Buenos Aires.<br/>It's not easy to find really good rating and you have to speak at least basic Spanish so they will not cheat you so much. But still it's worth it!<br/>We've read in so many travel blogs how Argentina is so expensive country. If we would know how actually cheap can be and how awesome country it is, we plan much more time for our trip then two weeks. It is not definitely so cheap like Bolivia or Peru but it is much less expensive the Europe. The south and Patagonia is probably another story. We believe that now after more democratic president was elected, the ARP will become stronger and it will be impossible for backpackers to go there. On the other hand, the modern and lovely people deserve much better then change every month their salary on the Blue market and deal with this scam.</p><p><img src="/img/mendoza/mendoza1.jpg" alt="Mendoza" title="Mendoza""/></p><h2>About</h2><p>Visiting Mendoza is about eating excellent steaks, drinking delicious wine and visiting bodegas (wineries) and olivicolas (olive oil producers). However, are also coming to Mendoza because it is a good starting point to climb Aconcagua, the highest mountain in the Southern hemisphere.<br/>There are hundreds of wineries and it is pretty difficult to manage visit more then three in one day. We recommend you to spend at least three days in the region, five days would be better. If you can, rent a bike and go around. But please, don't get drunk too much, because Argentinians are crazy drivers...<br/>They say that Mendoza is very dry region, it is very good for the wine. However, we got two rainy days out of three. The city is surprisingly very green, we found many parks and beautiful squares where people of Mendoza were having a rest from the hot weather.</p><p><img src="/img/mendoza/mendoza2.jpg" alt="Mendoza" title="Mendoza""/></p><h2>How to get to Mendoza from San Pedro de Atacama</h2><p>First we traveled to Salta, where we spent one night. Otherwise it would be to much, do it at once. Anyway the direct connection even doesn't exist. It is pretty difficult to get from San Pedro, because there is just one bus leaving the city every day. There are three companies operating on this route, Pullman, Gemini and Andesmar. You can buy tickets from Andesmar online, but we don't recommend you to do so. We found different prices, from 50 USD to 80 USD. In the office we paid 20 000 CLP (28 USD). Try to buy the tickets ASAP when you arrive to San Pedro because they are often sold out. You can also make a reservation of the ticket with Gemini, the price is almost the same (25 000 CLP), send them email with your personal data (name, birth date, nationality, passport number) <a href="mailto:&#101;p&#105;&#x7a;&#x61;&#x72;&#x72;&#111;&#x40;&#x67;e&#109;&#x69;&#110;i&#115;&#46;&#99;l">&#101;p&#105;&#x7a;&#x61;&#x72;&#x72;&#111;&#x40;&#x67;e&#109;&#x69;&#110;i&#115;&#46;&#99;l</a>. But make sure that they confirmed your reservation, we had problem with them and we almost didn't leave the city on time because of them.<br/>Try to have on you some ARS or arrive to Salta in the day time.<br/>There are moneychangers everywhere in the city center, mainly around the main square 9. de Julio. We got lucky in one of the restaurants with terrace on the square and we got the exchange rate 15 ARS/1 USD. Check every note, if it has perforation and watermark. The moneychangers are calling "cambio, cambio".<br/>After you change your money, buy your tickets on the bus terminal. We chose Via Bariloche because they gave us 30% discount and also offered us 30% discount on tickets from Mendoza to Buenos Aires. Instead of more then 900 ARS we paid 665 ARS p.p. one way. Because we changed our money on the Blue market and got the discount, we crossed the whole country on budget.<br/>The journey from San Pedro to Salta took 12 hours and from Salta to Mendoza 15 hours.</p><p><img src="/img/mendoza/mendoza3.jpg" alt="Mendoza" title="Mendoza""/></p><h2>Attractions</h2><h3>The wineries in Maipu</h3><p>The closest winery location to Mendoza is Maipu. You could buy a tour in hostel or from travel agency, but it is much cheaper and independent do it yourself. We wanted to rent bikes, but we didn't have enough time and they wanted to charge us way too much money. On the end, everything was in walking distance.<br/>First go to information kiosk, it is in the city center on San Martin street. They will give you maps with the wineries and also tell you how to get to Maipu. It is pretty easy, buy the Mendoza card for public transport in any kiosk, costs 7 ARS and charge it (one way is 4 ARS p.p.). There are also buses going to Maipu, we decided to go with Metrotranvia (fast tramway). We went from the station on corner of Belgrano and Juan B. Justo/Av. Las Heras, close to Carefour hypermarket and got off on the last stop, General Gutierrez. </p><h4>Bodegas Lopez</h4><p>This winery is just 10 minutes walking from the station General Gutierrez. It's one of the biggest and oldest wineries in the region. The third and fourth generation of the founding family still manage the bodega. It's a bit more industrial, but the free tour is worth it. We did the tour in Spanish, but we are sure that there are also some in English. Our guide was very knowledgeable and explained us the whole process, from growing the wine plants, harvesting wine to fermentation and aging. We saw the manufacture halls and then we tasted three samples of their delicious wine. On the end we got 15% discount in their shop and we bought 3 bottles of wine for 105 ARS (7 USD). The tour was free of admission. Address:Ozamis J. A. 375, M5511APG Maipú</p><p><a href="http://www.bodegaslopez.com.ar/paginas/index.php?idioma=en&menuP=home&seccion=home">http://www.bodegaslopez.com.ar/paginas/index.php?idioma=en&menuP=home&seccion=home</a></p><p><img src="/img/mendoza/mendoza4.jpg" alt="Mendoza" title="Mendoza""/></p><p><img src="/img/mendoza/mendoza5.jpg" alt="Mendoza" title="Mendoza""/></p><p><img src="/img/mendoza/mendoza6.jpg" alt="Mendoza" title="Mendoza""/></p><h4>Bodegas Cecchin</h4><p>It is a bit far from the Bodegas Lopez, 6.7 km. We were walking the distance, but for sure you can take a bus or rent a bike. They produce organic wine. It is more difficult to grow and produce ecological wine, as chemical herbicides can't be used and it is necessary to wait ten years for the earth get clean from them.<br/>They also grow biodynamic wine, found on more understanding to the nature and in more spiritual way. The said that they harvest the wine just when it's full moon, so you don't have any hangover after drinking this wine.<br/>We got less explanation about the wine producing but more samples to taste then in the Bodega Lopez:) We visited this bodega for free, because we joined larger group and befriend their guide. Usually you have to pay small admission. The wines are more expensive then in the previous one, but it was worth it (we bought one bottle for 65 ARS).<br/>It is very recommended to visit their restaurant also, they are have very good ranking on Tripadvisor and it shouldn't be expensive. They are opened just for lunch.<br/>Did we have hangover after drinking this wine? Of course not! Or maybe we just don't remember:)<br/>Address:Ruta 60 S/N., 5517 Russel, Maipu</p><p><a href="http://www.bodegacecchin.com.ar/">http://www.bodegacecchin.com.ar/</a></p><p><img src="/img/mendoza/mendoza7.jpg" alt="Mendoza" title="Mendoza""/></p><p><img src="/img/mendoza/mendoza8.jpg" alt="Mendoza" title="Mendoza""/></p><p><img src="/img/mendoza/mendoza9.jpg" alt="Mendoza" title="Mendoza""/></p><h3>Olivicola Simone</h3><p>After drinking so much wine we decided to eat something. We came pretty late, around five o'clock, they were still opened and to our surprise there was just the owner to give us the explanation. He told us about three different types of olive oil what they produce and let us taste. One of them was very spicy, one mild and one blend of these two. We tasted the olive oil with bread. Then we tasted different types of olives, he showed us around their manufacture hall and played us short video. On the end we could decide if we will buy something or we will pay 50 ARS admission. We bought one liter of olive oil and one kilogram of black olives for 100 ARS (6.7 USD). In front of the olivicola is a bus station. You can get from there to the center of Mendoza for 4 ARS.<br/>Address:Ozamis J. A. 1553, 5515 Maipú (close to Cecchin Bodega)</p><p><img src="/img/mendoza/mendoza10.jpg" alt="Mendoza" title="Mendoza""/></p><p>This trip cost us 286 ARS for both of us, including 4 bottles of wine, one liter of HQ olive oil, one kilogram of olives and the transport (19 USD). We also dinner with steak and bottle of wine nearby for 300 ARS (15 USD). So together for this amazing day we spent around 34 USD. You can not beat this price. The organized trips starts on 350 ARS p.p. (23 USD), including just the transport and poor lunch (sandwich). If you want something better with really good lunch and bikes included it is about 1000 ARS (66 USD).</p><h2>Food</h2><h3>Caro Pepe</h3><p>This all you can eat restaurant was our favorite restaurant in Mendoza. Go there when you are really hungry. You can choose anything from Asado (BBQ pieces of beef, chicken, pork, sausages), pasta, saladas or side dishes to desserts. We ordered three times bistek (beefsteak) and tasted different side dishes. Everything was very good, but the best was the meat and the wine we ordered, Malbec from winery Zuccardi (100 ARS). We paid 150 ARS p.p. so together 400 ARS (26.6 USD) and we didn't want to eat anything the next day:) Address:Las Heras 150, Mendoza</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Caro-Pepe/203216266365635">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Caro-Pepe/203216266365635</a></p><p><img src="/img/mendoza/mendoza11.jpg" alt="Mendoza" title="Mendoza""/></p><p><img src="/img/mendoza/mendoza12.jpg" alt="Mendoza" title="Mendoza""/></p><h2>Where to stay</h2><h3>Hostel Internacional Mendoza</h3><p>We can not really recommend this place from different reason. However it was very cheap, just 20 USD per night for double room with private bathroom. We really liked the social area and organized events for guests. The room wasn't clean and the mattress was the worst in our trip. The breakfast was included in the price. The manager was still pushing us to buy some of their over priced trips and we heard from another guests that they weren't content with them. It is located close to the city center. Address:Av. España 343, 5500 Mendoza</p><p><a href="http://www.hostelmendoza.net/">http://www.hostelmendoza.net/</a></p></p>
