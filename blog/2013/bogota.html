			<p><h2>Museo Botero</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.banrepcultural.org/museo-botero">http://www.banrepcultural.org/museo-botero</a></li>
</ul><p>Most of the art collection in this museum was donated by the famous columbian artist Fernando Botero. This musem is for free and it houses also a numismatic museum. Botero has a very distinct style and you might find that he is obsessed with painting fat people, but the truth is all of his objects are voluminous.</p><p>Botero has said about his figures, “What I say is that they are not fat, but voluminous. If I make a fruit, a landscape, an animal, a man, anything, it is a deformation to exalt volume. So I do not see them as fat, but as voluminous. Fat can also be Michelangelo, Masaccio or all Florentine art that is voluminous.”</p><p>Besides of Boteros paintings and sculptures you can admire paintings from Picasso, Gustav Klimt, Max Ernst, Joan Miro, Salvador Dalí and many more.</p><h2>Museo del oro (Museum of gold)</h2><p>This is the biggest museum of gold in south america. Its a beatiful museum with thousands of gold, silver, cupper and titanium artifacts from the ancient indian history. Not only can you admire the artifacts but the exhibiition tells you a story how this objects were made, and how they were used in ceremonies and what spiritual role they played in the life of the ancient people.</p><p>You can read about priest and shamans who identified them selfs with bats evoked this animal habits in they own, they lived in dark temples, worked at night and flew when they were in transes.</p><p>Yopo, powerful halucinogen that was extracted from the Anadenanthera tree, came from the Eastern Plains. It was inhaled using a small spoon or bird bone from trays with animals depicted on them that conjured up images of the transformations that were experienced.</p><p>The entry fee is only 3000 COP (1 EUR)</p><h2>Free street art tour</h2>

</ul><h2>Monserrate</h2><p>Monserrate is a church on top of the hill. You can either access it by walking up the very steep steps (at least 45 min. hard climb walking) or you can go for the easier option by cable car. The costs for the cable car is 8500 COP one way, and you can return walking (30 min). The return ticket is 17000 COP. On the top of the hill you can find a monastery, small botanic garden and a market with hand crafted products and food. If you choose walking the path to or from Monserrate </p><h2>National Museum</h2><p>Its admission free and currently undergoing a reconstruction. Most of the descriptions and informations are written only in spanish. However there is one remarkable exhibiton room with marverlous paintings and projections which dont need much of explanations. </p><h2>Grafity tour</h2><p>Meeting point is at placa de periodistas at 10am or 2pm nearby the statue of Simon Bolivar. The tour takes around 2.5 hours and goes through la caneleria district and finishes in downtown. Be prepared to hear tons of informations not only about the graffity and artists but also about social and economic issues of bogota. Other then than you will get tips on restaurants, bars, alternative shops and galleries. </p><p>Street art in Bogota is nowadays well established and recognized by its citizens, landlords and shop owners. Street art is present everywhere. but especialy in candelaria, where artists can even work by daylight in safe zones. Some landlords choose to commission international artists to avoid having their fasade beeing randomly tagged. </p><p>You will see pieces from Guecho, Rodez, Crisp, Likme, APC, Bastardia, DJ lu,</p><p>Even though the tour is free a tip of 20000 - 30000 COP is appropriate.</p><h2>Food</h2><h3>Dos Gatos y simon</h3><p>It is a cozy restaurant and the food is good. It is easy to miss, because it is all painted with graffity from the outside. We chose estofado, which is meat with rice, some veggies, guacamole and salsa. The meat was tender and juicy, the sauce and the guacamole were nicely seasoned and tasty. One meal was with 20.000 COP a bit pricey for Bogota.</p><h3>Tao calentao</h3><p>The biggest problem with this place is to find it. Its hidden in small alley close to Universidad de los andes. Ask the students around they will point you in in the right direction. Calentao is a typical colombian dish from rice, meat, beans and vegetables. You can select all ingredients yourself, or choose from one of the four versions on the menu (argentinian, thai, mexican, italian ). This is a bistro style and the food is prepared in front of you. Prices are reasonable and the portions are huge. We had troubles to finish our meals. We paid 28.000 COP for two meals with lemonade.</p><h3>Palo Quemao market</h3><p>The market is far from the center and getting there by foot is possible, but don't draw too much attention onto yourself as you are walking through some shady neighbourhoods. It's located on the corner of Carrera 28 and Calle 19 in front of a modern shopping center. In the market you can find large selection of fruits, vegetables and herbs. Inside the market you can find several stands with authentic, home made cuisine. We had two soups, two main dishes (large portion of fried and barbecued chicken leg, lentils, platano and arepa) and limonade and we paid just 10 000 COP. The portions are big and the locals were super friendly to us. </p></p>
