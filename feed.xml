      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/minca/minca_header.jpg&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We went for a walk to the river. On the way there we saw mangoes on the ground, unfortunately most of them were rotten or covered with insects. We did not give up and kept searching. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is something about eating fresh handpicked fruit, full of taste and juice. It reminds you of the good old times spent in grandmothers garden. The taste of childhood that you can hardly find anywhere else. We felt like little children eating mangoes that we found on the ground directly under the tree. For the first time in our lives we tasted real fresh mangoes. It was a magic experience - sweet, juicy, soft and full of flavor, incomparable to mangoes that you can buy in Europe.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Wandering under the trees, looking for more mangoes a local approached us with a big smile and in his hands he was holding four big, ripe mangoes. Surprised as we were, we almost pulled out money to pay him. Minca people are friendly and forthcoming and they make you feel like home. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/minca/minca2.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Minca Mango&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Minca Mango&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Transportation&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you want to relax and run away from hot and busy Santa Marta, go to Minca. It is 40 minutes drive from Santa Marta. Since Minca is in the hills the temperatures are a bit cooler. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To get there, go to the market in Santa Marta and ask for a car/jeep to Minca. They leave when the car is filled with passengers and they charge 7000 COP. Don&amp;#39;t forget to take enough cash with you, as there is no ATM in Minca.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;About&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Minca is a unique place to live. In the morning you can swim in the sea, for the lunch you can enjoy the rain forest and in the evening you can go for mountain biking in the hills. The mountain peaks of Sierra Nevada are covered with snow.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;#39;s one of the most beautiful places we&amp;#39;ve seen in Colombia. The flora in Minca has emerald green color and you can hear birds singing and the river flowing. It is a quiet and peaceful place. Sierra Nevada has a huge biodiversity and it is home to toucans, skunks, jaguars, monkeys, caimans and hummingbirds. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Indians consider Sierra Nevada to be the center of the world, or as they call it &amp;quot;pachamama&amp;quot;. It is understandable, the nature is very rich and provided the indigenous people with food for centuries.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Minca is also a well known coffee region with many coffee farms (fincas). Furthermore the cocoa plant grows wildly in Sierra Nevada.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a small town 650 meters above the sea level. In the past it wasn&amp;#39;t the safest place, since F.A.R.C. (guerrilla group) was controlling this area. The locals told us that the police station was destroyed twice by bombs. The guerrillas were growing marijuana all over the area to finance the organization. The plants are still growing wildly in the forest and you can make out the distinct smell of it. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nowadays everything is different. Minca is a safe place, visited by tourist every day. Several expats settled down here and build up hotels and restaurants in this little town.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/minca/minca1.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Minca&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Minca&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/minca/minca11.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Minca&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Minca&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/minca/minca12.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Minca&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Minca&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/minca/minca13.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Minca&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Minca&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Attractions&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Finca Victoria&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The finca is located 8 km from the village. You can either take a mototaxi (8.000 COP) or you can walk, like we did. It&amp;#39;s a bit difficult hike up the hills, especially in a hot day, but you will be rewarded with amazing views and if you are lucky you will see some animals on the way. We spotted a small armadillo in the bushes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The coffee farm was founded by an English family in 1892. Later on a German family, escaping from Europe because of world war II, took over the finca. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The finca is also home to a small brewery. The water comes from the river, the barley from Germany and hops from Czech Republic. They make two types. Happy tucan is a red ale and happy jaguar is a pilsner.The young German guy that owns the brewery knows how to make good beer. We give it a thumbs up.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The most important business of the finca is coffee production. They will explain you the whole process. From the harvest to cleaning coffee beans and sorting them by quality. At the end of the tour you will taste their coffee and you can buy some coffee. Astonishingly the whole farm is operated by 120 years old machines and a water turbine. They are not thinking about replacing them, the machines still do their job and the generated electricity powers the finca and the surrounding houses. The tour takes 40 minutes, it&amp;#39;s in Spanish and cost 10.000 COP p.p. Recently a group of French people opened a bistro in the finca, where you can buy beer from the local brewery and home made sandwiches.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/minca/minca9.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Minca finca victoria&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Minca finca victoria&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/minca/minca10.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Minca finca victoria&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Minca finca victoria&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Cocoa workshop&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Arriving from Santa Marta to Minca, there are two houses on the right side. It&amp;#39;s a cafeteria serving home made cakes and coffee and selling chili sauces and chocolates. We bought a spicy mango-chili salsa. Next to the cafeteria is a small information stand. The guy there told us so many informations about history of Minca and about the local products (honey, salsas, coffee, chocolate products). It was a long but pleasant conversation and he didn&amp;#39;t force us to buy anything. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They are offering one day tours around Minca and Sierra Nevada. They will take you to Finca Victoria, Palo Alto (a view where you can see two highest mountains of Sierra Nevada-Colon and Bolivar), the waterfalls and a chocolate workshop. It costs 55.000 COP p.p. You can go by yourself and visit the places for free. The loop around minca is cca. 20km long. Ask for a map.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.junglejoeminca.com/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Jungle Joe&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; is offering bird watching excursions for 25.000 COP p.p.. There is a good chance he will be around since his office is also in the same house. Bird watching is every day from 6 a.m. and finish at 9 a.m. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The cocoa workshop was interesting. Firstly he gave us to try raw chocolate seeds and shells (they have high content of theobromine, a substance making people happy). Then he mixed grounded raw beans with coconut oil (it helps the product to stay solid, as coconut oil has solid form up to 25 degrees) and then we could choose the flavor. From three organic fruit marmalades we choose the blackberry one. Then he mixed everything, grounded the paste, put in a form and let it sit for 15 minutes in a freezer. It was delicious.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/minca/minca8.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Minca cocoa workshop&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Minca cocoa workshop&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/minca/minca7.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Minca cocoa workshop&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Minca cocoa workshop&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Pozo Azul&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This waterfall is located cca. one hour walk from Minca, on the way to Finca Victoria. You can swim in crystal clear water, but we have to say that it is very cold.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/minca/minca5.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Minca Pozo Azul&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Minca Pozo Azul&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/minca/minca6.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Minca Pozo Azul&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Minca Pozo Azul&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Where to stay&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are a few hostels and hotels in all price categories. We heard that Casa Loma is a really cool place, they have amazing view, but the double rooms are very expensive. We chose Casa Colibri, which is just few minutes from Casa Loma. The owner is French and his wife Venezuelan. They are very friendly and we felt like at home. You can have a rest in a hammock and observe hummingbirds. Their breakfast is good. We had pancakes with fruits. The hostel is very clean and rooms have enough space. We paid around 60.000 COP per night for a double room. The breakfast is 5.000 COP.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Food&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are plenty of restaurants to choose from. On the way to Pozo Azul, just 15 minutes walking from Minca, is the restaurant Asador. We didn&amp;#39;t try but we passed by and it looked amazing. The chef was cutting big pieces of meat for the bbq. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Finca Victoria - French bistro&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They have homemade cakes, we tried their coffee cake. It was very good especially the topping with coffee flavor. We had the club sandwich with chicken, vegetables and egg and a croque-monsieur sandwich with dark bread, bechamel sauce and cheese and salad on the side. The bread is of European type and home made. With two happy tucan beers we paid 30.000 COP. A very pleasant change.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/minca/minca3.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Minca Finca Victoria&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Minca Finca Victoria&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/minca/minca4.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Minca Happy Tucan Beer&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Minca Happy Tucan Beer&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <title>Taganga</title>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">blog/2015/taganga.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/taganga/taganga_header.jpg&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Taganga is a small hippie/fisherman village close to Santa Marta. To get there, catch a collectivo bus anywhere in Santa Marta, it cost 1.400 COP p.p. (0.50 EUR) or take a taxi. It&amp;#39;s just a few minutes drive from the city.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Taganga is a party place. You will meet interesting travelers and hippies and you will probably extend your stay like we did. You plan to come for few days and you might stay for few weeks, like many of the guests we met at the hostels, or as one of the locals explained to us: &amp;quot;You come to Taganga normal, you leave crazy, you come to Taganga crazy, you leave normal&amp;quot;. With the good vibes of this small fishing village you will loose track of time. You can ask around for a volunteering job in the hostels and get a dorm bed and one meal per day in exchange for 6 hours work five days per week. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Transportation&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you go from Cartagena and you want to travel cheap, take the collectivo (small bus that stops anywhere) for 1.800 COP to bus terminal, the ride from the center takes around 1 hour. Once you have arrived at the bus terminal, ignore hustlers and any friendly advisors and go straight to the counters. Ask for a direct bus to Santa Marta. We went with Berlinave for 20.000 COP p.p. (7 EUR) in a bus with AC and a toilet. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Beaches&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The local beach one is not the most picturesque, however there are plenty of restaurants and bars and the water is clean. You can always go to Playa Grande, which is much cleaner. Don&amp;#39;t listen to any advisors and walk there. It will take you just 15 minutes and it&amp;#39;s doable in flip flops. Advantage of going by foot, is the beautiful view over the village and the bay. The path to Playa Grande starts at the very far right of the local beach, just below the hotel that is located on the hill side. At the playa are several restaurants and seats to rent. Swimming at Playa Grande reminded us of swimming in a lake, because the water is so calm and cool. It can be crowded and loud on the weekends, so it&amp;#39; s better to continue your way further around the bay and find &amp;quot;your beach&amp;quot;. Further out are a few small, hidden beaches with only a handful of people. It would be a perfect place, if the hills were not covered with plastic bottles and trash. We think that the people are missing environmental education and we hope that this will change one day. The village is still unspoiled by mass tourism. There are no big hotels or posh restaurants. On the contrary, we hope this won&amp;#39;t change!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/taganga/taganga1.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Taganga&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Playa Blanca&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/taganga/taganga4.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Taganga&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Playa Blanca&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/taganga/taganga6.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Taganga&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Playa Blanca&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/taganga/taganga3.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Taganga&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Playa Blanca&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Where to stay&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you stay during the weekend book a room in advance. There are plenty of cheap hostels, some of them are dirty and half empty and you can&amp;#39;t really socialize. If you are a party animal and you don&amp;#39;t mind to be nonstop with people, go to the hostel Nirvana. They have only dormitories with 15 bunk beds, a swimming pool in the courtyard. Most of the guests are in their twenties.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;If you want a nice, cozy and quiet place, go to the Garden House hostel or the &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.lacasadefelipe.com&amp;quot;&amp;gt;San Felipe&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; hostel. We stayed at San Felipe. It&amp;#39;s a bit more expensive for Taganga, 65.000 COP (22.60 EUR) per night for a double room, but it is worth it. You have your own bathroom with a toilet, fan and a safe. It&amp;#39;s located at the foot of a hill. It has a &amp;quot;mirador&amp;quot;, a terrace with a view over the see, where you can relax in hammocks. You can use a kitchen and a lounge with TV as well. The breakfast cost from 4.000 COP to 7.000 COP. We loved their coffee. This was by far the cleanest Hotel on our trip in Colombia.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We also stayed three nights in Alquimista hostal, which is one of the cheapest in the village. They have dorms in the main building, where you can also find a patio with kitchen, bar, TV and couches. The price of a dorm bed with AC is 18.000 COP (6.30 EUR) per night, but we recommend you to find a buddy and rent a double room. The double rooms (3 in total) are located in another building, just 50 meters from the main one, so it&amp;#39;s more quiet. It costs 39.000 COP (13.50 EUR) per night, so there is almost no difference in the price. There is a lounge, terrace, kitchen and a bathroom. Breakfast is included.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The drinks on the bar are very cheap. Carlos, the manager, employs young volunteers who speak English. We had a lot of fun here and we were coming back even when we were staying in San Felipe.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Food&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Street food is available at the entire beach promenade. You can get arepas, tortillas or sausages and fresh juices and cocktails. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Dunkarinka&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The best fish we&amp;#39;ve had in Colombia. Go for menu del dia and ask what fish they have on menu. We were in Colombia in the season of mojarra, which is a good average fish. For a change we put a little bit more money and we ordered the sierra fish. It&amp;#39;s a big fish with enough meat for two people. Like always it came with coconut rice, salad and a fish soup and we paid 15.000 COP (5,20 EUR) p.p. They will also ask you how you want it to be prepared. We tried fried and barbecued fish before, so this time we ordered it cooked in a vegetable salsa. The salsa was delicious, the fish juicy, soft like butter and not greasy like when fried.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/taganga/fish_sierra1.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Playa Blanca&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Playa Blanca&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/taganga/fish_sierra2.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Playa Blanca&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Taganga&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Don&amp;#39;t go to &amp;quot;Barracuda&amp;quot;, terrible service and the worst food what we&amp;#39;ve had here. &amp;quot;Yammy Yammy&amp;quot; wasn&amp;#39;t bad and it&amp;#39;s cheap, we enjoyed their juices.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Nightlife&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The gringo discos by the beach playing &amp;quot;international music&amp;quot; (Rihanna, David Guetta, Pit bull and other commercial crap). If you ask around, you can find nice parties, especially on the weekends.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;We were in the Compass bar, it&amp;#39;s located up the hill nearby the football playground. It&amp;#39;s a garden bar and sometimes they have live music. We were there for a concert of cumbia music, the band is called Kumbia Kuatika. The band is originally from Argentina. They play traditional Peruvian cumbia. Their repertoire includes big classics of Peruvian and Colombian cumbia or &amp;quot;chicha&amp;quot; but mostly they play their own songs. The music is very live and temper and that&amp;#39;s what we like.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;You will be offered a variety of substances in Taganga. It&amp;#39;s your choice, but what we heard is not reasonable to walk around with it in the night. The everywhere present police can stop and frisk you and then escort you to the ATM...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/cartagena/cartagena_header.jpg&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Attractions&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Playa Blanca&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are several ways how to get to Playa Blanca. You can either buy a tour from guides on the street, in your hostel or you can get there on your own with a bus and a boat. We read on the internet that you can try to find a spot on a boat close to Mercado Bazurto and you don&amp;#39;t have to pay 12.000 COP (4.20 EUR) park fee. Afterwards we met other travelers, who confirmed that it is possible to get to Playa Blanca on your own for 10.000 COP (3.50 EUR) one way p.p. and sleep in a hammock for 20.000 COP (7 EUR) per night.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We chose the easy way and booked a tour for 85.000 COP (29.50 EUR) p.p. including transportation and accommodation for one night on Playa Blanca. The chartered bus took us to a small harbor, where a boat was waiting for us. The ride with the boat takes around 1 hour. We stayed at &amp;quot;Hostal Playa Blanca&amp;quot; in a small hut-like room (cabana). All hostels are located directly on the beach 10m max from the sea. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The beach is amazing, the sand is almost white and the water warm and turquoise. The locals stay on one side of the beach which is very crowded. Most of the hostels are on the other side of the beach where it is more quiet and not that busy. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You will find various restaurants and stands with food on Playa Blanca. We recommend to go to the part where the locals are staying and where you can order a plate with fresh fish for 10.000 - 12.000 COP (3.50 - 4.20 EUR). In the evening the prices can double. The salesmen with the stalls offer overpriced shrimps or langustas (from august), but you can always bargain with them. We wanted a portion of shrimps and the merchant started with 30.000 COP. We were able to negotiate it down to 15.000 COP (5.20 EUR). Same goes for cocktails. They can prepare fancy cocktails for you served in a pineapple or coconut. We bargained the price for two pineapple piña coladas to 23.000 COP (8 EUR), 7.000 COP less then the initial price. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can rent a jet ski for 30.000 COP (10.50 EUR) per 15 minutes. We borrowed snorkels, but we did not see anything interesting on the sea bed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/cartagena/playa_blanca1.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Playa Blanca&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Playa Blanca&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/cartagena/playa_blanca2.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Playa Blanca&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Playa Blanca&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;City center&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The historic center is small and is surrounded by city walls. The architecture is similar to southern cities in Spain. The buildings have nice, refreshing patios and the balconies are covered with flowers. Just take a camera and get lost for few hours. This district is posh and bit more expensive then the rest of the city. You can find very expensive restaurants, boutique hotels and jewelery shops, specialized in emeralds. We saw nice design shops selling original swimsuits, shoes and hand made jewelery. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you want to save money you can eat on the street or find restaurants that offer menu del dia and live in a hostel at district Getsemani. Unfortunately we didn&amp;#39;t have enough time to explore Getsemani. It&amp;#39;s covered with street art, we saw pieces from Bogotas artist DjLu on Calle de la Sierpe. Visit Plaza de la Trinidad in the evening hours, where locals hang out. Have some fresh arepas or hamburgers from the stalls. Afterwards you can go to one of the many bars, they have happy hours for cocktails and special offers, like 2 for 20.000 COP (7 EUR). We heard that on Calle Arsenal has several cool clubs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/cartagena/cartagena_center1.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Cartagena Center&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Cartagena Center&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/cartagena/cartagena_center2.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Cartagena Center&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Cartagena Center&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Naval museum&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;#39;s located in the historic center and the admission is 8.000 COP (2.80 EUR) p.p.. The museum has two large wings. The lower one is dedicated to the naval history of Colombia and especially Cartagena de Indias. You could spend hours reading the information boards, few of them are in English. The second wing is dedicated to the modern Colombian navy. We had lot of fun in a model of submarine command bridge, pushing buttons, playing with periscope and shooting enemy ships. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Food&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Try some fresh fish or sea food you are on the coast after all. When we were there in July it was the season for Mujarra, a very tasty fish. Menu del dia will set you back 10.000-15.000 COP. In the evening the street sellers offer classic arepa con queso (grilled corn paddy filled with cheese) for 1.000 COP (0.35 EUR). Besides that they offer meat sticks, potatoes filled with meat or fried cheese rolls. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/cartagena/food1.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Mujarra Fish&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Mujarra Fish&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Restaurante Atahualpa&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We chose the menu with fish for 10.000 COP (3.50 EUR). The fish soup was very good with whole pieces of meat and yuka, sprinkled with cilantro leaves and lime juice. The main course consists of fish, rice, beans in a sauce and pickled vegetables. The portions were big. We also recommend to try their lulu juice. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/cartagena/food2.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Food&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Food&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.banrepcultural.org/museo-botero&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http://www.banrepcultural.org/museo-botero&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Most of the items in this museum were donated by the famous Colombian artist Fernando Botero. This museum is for free and it also houses a numismatic museum. Botero has a very distinct style and you might find that he is obsessed with painting fat people. Botero said about his figures, “What I say is that they are not fat, but voluminous. If I make a fruit, a landscape, an animal, a man, anything, it is a deformation to exalt volume. So I do not see them as fat, but as voluminous. Fat can also be Michelangelo, Masaccio or all Florentine art that is voluminous.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Besides Boteros paintings and sculptures you can admire paintings from Picasso, Gustav Klimt, Max Ernst, Joan Miro, Salvador Dalí and many more. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/bogota/botero_horse.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Boteros Horse&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Botero Horse&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/bogota/botero_monalisa.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Botero Monalisa&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Boteros Monalisa&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/bogota/joan_miro.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Joan Miro&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Joan Miro&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Museo del oro (Museum of gold)&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is the biggest museum of gold in South America. It displays thousands of gold, silver and coper artifacts from the ancient indian history. Not only can you admire the artifacts but the exhibition tells a story on how the objects were made and how they were used in ceremonies and what spiritual role they played in the life of the ancient people.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can read about priests and shamans who identified them selfs with bats, evoked this animal habits in they own, they lived in dark temples, worked at night and flew when they were in transes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yopo, a powerful hallucinogen that was extracted from the Anadenanthera tree, came from the Eastern Plains. It was inhaled using a small spoon or bird bone from trays with animals depicted on them that conjured up images of the transformations that were experienced.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The entry fee is only 3.000 COP (1 EUR)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/bogota/museo_del_oro.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Museo del oro&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Museo del oro - trays and bones for snorting&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Monserrate&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Monserrate is the hill above Candelaria and the city center. You can either access it by walking up the very steep steps (at least 60 min. hard climbing) or you can go for the easier option and take the cable car. The costs for the cable car is 8.500 COP (3 EUR) one way. You can return walking (30 min.). The return ticket is 17.000 COP (6 EUR). On the top of the hill are a monastery, small botanic garden and a market with hand crafted products and food. The view of the city is spectacular.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;National Museum&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is admission free and currently undergoing a reconstruction. Most of the descriptions and informations are written only in Spanish. However there is one remarkable exhibition room with marvelous paintings and projections which does not require any explanations. We have never before seen an exhibition room like this. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/bogota/national_museum.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;National Museum&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;National Museum&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Graffiti tour&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Meeting point is at Plaza de Periodistas at 10am or 2pm nearby the statue of Simon Bolivar. The tour takes around 2.5 hours and goes through La Candeleria district and finishes in downtown. Be prepared to hear tons of informations not only on the graffiti and the artists but also on social and economic issues of Bogota. Other then that you will get tips on restaurants, bars, alternative shops and galleries. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Street art in Bogota is nowadays well established and recognized by its citizens, landlords and shop owners. Street art is present everywhere but especially in Candelaria, where artists can even work by daylight in safe zones. Some landlords choose to commission international artists to avoid having their facade being tagged. Once the facade is covered with a piece, other artists respect it and they don&amp;#39;t paint over it. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You will see pieces from Guecho, Rodez, Crisp, Likme, APC, Bastardia, DjLu,&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even though the tour is free a tip of 20.000 - 30.000 COP (7 - 10 EUR) is appropriate.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/bogota/street_art1.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Street art - La Candelaria&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Street art - La Candelaria&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/bogota/street_art2.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Street art&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Street art&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/bogota/street_art3.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Street art - Toxicomano&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Street art - Toxicomano&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/bogota/street_art4.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Street art&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Street art&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Where to stay&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Candelaria&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is the historic center of Bogota. Some of the colonial houses are dating back 500 years. There are no two identical buildings. You will find many design shops, cheap hostels, restaurants and bars over there. Most of the historic monuments (Plaza Bolivar, Museo Botero, Monserrate ... ) are in walking distance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Several universities are located in the Candelaria district. Many students and young people come to Plaza de Quevedo to enjoy street performances (mostly live music) and drinks (chicha, aquardiente or beer). This is definitely one of the best hot spots to meet with locals and have a drink.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We stayed in Casa Quevedo that is located at the Plaza de Quevedo and the party is right outside the door. Prices are around 50.000 COP (17 EUR) for a double room per night, breakfast included (eggs, bread, coffee). The 2nd floor has only two toilets which were not always clean.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Food&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Typical dishes from Bogota are Bandeja Paisa, which consists of meat, sausage, rice and beans and Aijaco, which is a soup with corn, yucca, potatoes and meat. If you are into sweats Columbia has a lot to offer. You can try pastry and cakes from tamarind, dulce de leche (caramelized condensed milk) and different types of fruit.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;When in Bogota try Chicha drink. It is fermented corn alcohol beverage, very sweet and sour. From Plaza Quevedo leads a narrow street in which every pub and bar serves this drink in a cup made out of totumo. Totumo is a typical plant for Colombia. Be warned that the portion is really big and not everyone likes the taste.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/bogota/food1.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Aijaco Soup&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Aijaco Soup&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Dos Gatos y Simone&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is a cozy restaurant and the food is good. It is easy to miss, because it is all painted with graffiti from the outside. We chose estofado, which is meat with rice, some veggies, guacamole and salsa. The meat was tender and juicy, the sauce and the guacamole were nicely seasoned and tasty. One meal was with 20.000 COP (7 EUR) a bit pricey for Bogota.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Tao Calentao&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The biggest problem with this place is to find it. It&amp;#39;s hidden in small alley close to Universidad de Los Andes. Ask the students around they will point you in in the right direction. Calentao is a typical Colombian dish from rice, meat, beans and vegetables. You can select all ingredients yourself, or choose from one of the four versions on the menu (Argentinian, Thai, Mexican, Italian ). This is a bistro style and the food is prepared in front of you. Prices are reasonable and the portions are huge. We had troubles to finish our meals. We paid 28.000 COP (9.70 EUR) for two meals with lemonade.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Plaza de Mercado de Paloquemao&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The market is far from the center. Getting there on foot is possible, but don&amp;#39;t draw too much attention onto yourself as you are walking through some shady neighborhoods. It&amp;#39;s located on the corner of Carrera 28 and Calle 19 in front of a modern shopping center. The market offers a large selection of fruits, vegetables and herbs. Inside the market you will find several stands with authentic, home made cuisine. We had two soups, two main dishes (large portion of fried and barbecued chicken leg, lentils, platano and arepa) and lemonade. Altogether we paid only 10.000 COP (3.50 EUR). The portions were big and the locals were super friendly to us. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <title>Berlin</title>
      <link>http://www.viabohemia.net/blog/2015/berlin.html</link>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">blog/2015/berlin.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When one of our best friends moved to Berlin, we knew that sooner or later we will come to visit him. Andrea has never been to Berlin before. She loves techno music, art and good food, so for her Berlin was a must-do-trip. Berlin is incredibly cheap, provided you eat on the street, drink beer (not cocktails) and you stay in a hostel rather then a hotel. In that case you can experience Berlin on a budget. Berlin offers lot of fun activities and attractions. To visit all of the techno clubs in Berlin, would be our favorite choice. However, if you are not into electronic music, Berlin offers lot of exhibitions, galleries, museums, concerts and a free street art tour, which we highly recommend. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can find more information here:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.visitberlin.de/en/see/museums-art/art&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http://www.visitberlin.de/en/see/museums-art/art&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.exberliner.com&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http://www.exberliner.com/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Free street art tour&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you like street art, join the alternative Berlin tour. Our guide Carl from Scotland who really loves this city and obviously knows a lot about the history and its underground subcultures. The tour started in the center, district Mitte. He showed us pieces from El Bocho, Sobre, Mr. Six and others. Then we moved on to the most &amp;quot;alternative&amp;quot; district, Kreuzberg. Since the tour we have looked at the city with different eyes, looking for art everywhere. We really appreciated that we were a small group about ten people and we didn&amp;#39;t disturb people around, because every time we kept distance. We also got tips about good restaurants and clubs where to go. This was a free tour and the three hours passed quickly, however we were very satisfied and left a tip and so did the rest of our group. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/berlin/berlin1.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Alt text&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Optional title&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/berlin/berlin2.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Alt text&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Optional title&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/berlin/berlin3.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Alt text&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Optional title&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;East Side Gallery&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/berlin/berlin4.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;East Side Gallery&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;East Side Gallery&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/berlin/berlin5.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;East Side Gallery&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;East Side Gallery&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is the longest open air gallery in the world with the most bitter history. That wall used to divide the city in two parts, the western and the eastern communist world. Many people died trying to cross it. Some of those who managed to flee had to leave rest of their families behind. It is the longest piece of the original Berlin wall with 101 murals from artists from all over the world and of course it is for free. It&amp;#39;s located in Mühlenstraße in Berlin Friedrichshain. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.eastsidegallery-berlin.de/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;East Side Gallery&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Techno clubs&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We have visited three clubs in two days, but you can go nonstop from Friday till Monday and there are so many of them that you won&amp;#39;t know what to choose. Of course you can use &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.residentadvisor.net/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Residentadvisor&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; but even better is to ask the locals for the most recent hot spots, because some of them are very touristy and that&amp;#39;s not the best you can get. You can try to get to &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.berghain.de/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Berghain&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, but count on a 2 hours queue and strong possibility that the bouncers wont let you in. Don&amp;#39;t go in large groups, and try to be of mixed gender, dressed preferably in dark clothes. Don&amp;#39;t draw too much attention on you, by speaking loudly or by being obviously drunk. Very popular and good techno clubs in the city are &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://aboutparty.net/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;://about blank&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.sisyphos-berlin.net/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Sysiphos&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.kitkatclub.org/Home/Club/Index.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Kitkat&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.water-gate.de/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Watergate&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We started on Saturday midnight in &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://tresorberlin.com/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Tresor&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and we were a bit too early, because the club was almost empty. On the other hand it was easy and quick to get in because there was no queue. Tresor is totally worth to see! Its dark, very charismatic and industrial. The void audio sound systems on both stages rocks.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Later that night we moved on to &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://griessmuehle.de/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Griessmuehle&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, which was probably one of our best techno events ever. We stayed only for three hours but it was a total blast. The club was hosting dj&amp;#39;s and producers from the &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://soundcloud.com/lobster-theremin&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Lobster Theremin&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; label. We are not sure if it was just because we were lucky to listen to such high quality techno music or if the club is organizing high class events like this every week. It was simply amazing. The interior and exterior is supporting this raw dirty techno atmosphere. There were no lights, no strobos on the main stage, just a bit of light from the bar which intensified the atmosphere. Be careful on the toilets which are the worst we have ever seen:) You can also chill out in the sun outside by the river.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Sunday night all major clubs play mostly minimal techno or housy music. Since we are not the biggest fans of that, we decided to go to the club R19, which turned out to be a mistake. Please don&amp;#39;t go there! Just if you like bad music, cyber techno or psytrance (I think it&amp;#39;s the same) and you can deal with weird people. Anyway it was an experience.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/berlin/berlin6.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Alt text&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Tresor&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Food&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.monsieurvuong.de/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Monsieur Vuong&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, Alte Schoenhauser Str. 46&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Super fast service and good quality food. The food came five minutes after we have ordered. You can choose from a daily menu or order a la carte and the prices are more then reasonable, from 5-10 EUR. We ordered chicken with mango and minced meat rolls with noodles and fresh vegetables. Both dishes and the home made lemonade were super fresh. The Pho soup was ok, we have had better though. The service was efficient and nice. For two daily menu dishes, the pho soup and two home made lemonades we paid 33 EUR.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.curry36.de/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Curry 36&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, Mehringdamm 36 und Bahnhof Zoologischer Garten&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;They claim that it is the best curry wurst in the city, The sauce was obviously home made and Andrea chose an organic sausage which was juicy and soft. For a middle sized sausage with fries we paid 3,50 EUR. Nice and cheap lunch. 10 meters from Curry 36 is probably one of the best places to eat kebab but prepare yourself to wait for at least 30 minutes, it is called Mustafa. We were standing by watching people getting their kebabs and they looked awesome, very fresh and in big sizes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.burgermeister.berlin/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Burgermeister&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, Oberbaumstrasse 8&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This is very nice and cheap fast food in the Kreuzberg district. I would appreciate a bigger portion of meat, but what can you ask for if you pay 4 EUR for a burger. The bun was delicious and obviously home made, the fries were also very good. Waiting in the queue, ordering and preparation time, all together it took max 20 minutes to get our food.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/berlin/berlin7.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Burger from Burgermeister&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Burger from Burgermeister&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;What movies to watch and what to listen before (or while) you go&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Baader_Meinhof_Complex&amp;quot;&amp;gt;The Baader Meinhof Complex (2008)&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. is a 2008 German film by Uli Edel. Written and produced by Bernd Eichinger, it stars Moritz Bleibtreu, Martina Gedeck, and Johanna Wokalek. The film is based on the 1985 German best selling non-fiction book of the same name by Stefan Aust.

The movie immediately acquired cult status (which it still retains today) and features David Bowie as both himself and the soundtrack composer, which gave the movie a commercial boost. Both the movie and the book acquired cult status in Europe immediately after release, raising awareness of heroin addiction. The popularity of the movie was greatly boosted by David Bowie&amp;#39;s participation as both himself (portrayed giving a concert early in the movie) and as the main contributor to the soundtrack. Bowie&amp;#39;s music from his albums made in Berlin during 1976-77 is heavily featured throughout the picture, and as he was at the very peak of his popularity during the late 1970s-early 1980s, his presence helped boost the film&amp;#39;s commercial success.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/berlin/baader_meinhof_complex.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Baeder Meinhof Komplex&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;East Side Gallery&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/img/berlin/good_bye_lenin.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Baeder Meinhof Komplex&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;East Side Gallery&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ben Klock&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/benklock&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/benklock&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://soundcloud.com/ben-klock&amp;quot;&amp;gt;https://soundcloud.com/ben-klock&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Rødhåd&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/rodhad&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/rodhad&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://soundcloud.com/rodhad&amp;quot;&amp;gt;https://soundcloud.com/rodhad&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Marcel Dettman&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/marceldettmann&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/marceldettmann&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://soundcloud.com/marceldettmann&amp;quot;&amp;gt;https://soundcloud.com/marceldettmann&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sven Vath&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/svenvath&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/svenvath&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://soundcloud.com/hightension1053/sven-vath-live-time-warp-2015-mannheim-germany-06-04-2015&amp;quot;&amp;gt;https://soundcloud.com/hightension1053/sven-vath-live-time-warp-2015-mannheim-germany-06-04-2015&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Motor city drum ensemble&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/mcde&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/mcde&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://soundcloud.com/platform/motor-city-drum-ensemble-dekmantel&amp;quot;&amp;gt;https://soundcloud.com/platform/motor-city-drum-ensemble-dekmantel&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Chris Liebing&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/chrisliebing&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/chrisliebing&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://soundcloud.com/chris-liebing&amp;quot;&amp;gt;https://soundcloud.com/chris-liebing&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Pan Pot&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/pan-pot&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/pan-pot&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://soundcloud.com/pan-pot&amp;quot;&amp;gt;https://soundcloud.com/pan-pot&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ostgut ton&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.residentadvisor.net/record-label.aspx?id=803&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http://www.residentadvisor.net/record-label.aspx?id=803&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://soundcloud.com/ostgutton-official&amp;quot;&amp;gt;https://soundcloud.com/ostgutton-official&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cassy&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/cassy&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/cassy&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://soundcloud.com/cassy-official-1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;https://soundcloud.com/cassy-official-1&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>
